            <li>¼ teaspoon powdered yellow food coloring</li>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in yogurt and vinegar. Add onion; cook and stir until golden and tender.

            <li>Spread 1/2 of the cooked rice in the bottom of a large serving dish. Pour chicken mixture on top. Cover with remaining cooked rice. Sprinkle with food coloring; mix to serve.</li>
